|Implementation Ideas|
----------------------

Starting from raw ingredients :

0) What is the distribution of used ingredients in recipes ?                             | Very quick
   plot the number of time each ingredient is used in an histogram                       |

1) How are ingredients associated to each other (one by one) ?
Association graph (not directed, weighted), link all ingredients that appear             |
together in at least one recipe, the weight is the number of times they appear           | Medium
together. Can be extended by the 1-to-1 apriori rules.                                   |


2) Are there different, not easily associable, categories of ingredients ?               | Medium
   Apply a community detection algorithm (Grivan-Newman) to identify hidden              |
   categories

    2.1) if we found categories, what is a representative ingredient of each             | Quick
        category ? How can we interpret that ? Probably european vs Asian food           |

    2.2) if we found categories, is there one that is more nutritionally balanced ?       |
         Can we define nutritional profile per category given the ingredients ?           | Long
         -> e.g. if you lack protein, european is better because more meat (dumb example) |
         -> The profile would be how much of each nutrient we can get considering         |
            the ingredients

4) How to know what ingredients to put with others ?                                      | Quick
   Run apriori algorithm on recipes ingredients                                           |

   4.1) Are there cyclic rules ? How do we interpret them ?                               | Quick
        -> Must be classic dishes (e.g flour, sugar and eggs for cake)                    |


5) Can we found "swapable" ingredients ?                                                  | Very quick
   Lonk at the ingredients in the graph that have exactly the same neighbors.             |

6) Can we suggest replacement for an ingredient in a recipe ?                             |
   Look at the recipe ingredients, find a common link in the graph to which               |
   they are all connected :) We Should first look at the result in 5), and                | Depends
   ideally select an ingredient which has roughly the same nutritional values.            |
   Optional : if there are possible possibilities, rank them by healthiness               |
   according to the nutritional values                                                    |
